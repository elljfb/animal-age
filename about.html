                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>AnimalAge.info exists to provide pet owners with accurate, scientifically-grounded information about how their companions age. Too many pet owners rely on outdated myths like the "7-year rule" that don't reflect the biological reality of how different species actually age. Our mission is to replace these misconceptions with evidence-based knowledge that helps owners make informed decisions about their pets' care.</p>
                        <p>We believe that understanding your pet's true age and life stage is fundamental to providing excellent care throughout their entire lifespan. When you know your dog's logarithmic aging curve, your cat's 15/9/4 rule, or the factors affecting your parrot's decades-long lifespan, you're equipped to make better decisions about nutrition, exercise, healthcare, and quality of life.</p>

                        <h2>Our Approach: Authority, Accuracy, and Animal Welfare</h2>
                        <p><strong>Authority:</strong> Our content is grounded in peer-reviewed veterinary research. We draw from published studies on canine aging, feline development, avian lifespan, and senior pet care. We cite scientific sources and explain the reasoning behind our recommendations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Outdated information hurts pets. The "multiply by 7" rule misleads owners about their dogs' actual age and care needs. The simple "7-year rule" ignores size variation in dogs and the non-linear nature of canine aging. We're committed to accuracy because your pet's health depends on it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong> Everything we do is aimed at improving the lives of companion animals. Better understanding of aging leads to better nutrition, more appropriate exercise, earlier recognition of health problems, and more compassionate end-of-life care. We're advocates for animals, and that mission guides every article we publish.</p>

                        <h2>Why Accurate Age Calculation Matters</h2>
                        <p>Pet aging is not linear. Dogs don't age at the same rate throughout their lives, and different dog breeds age at different rates. Cats reach physical maturity in their first year, then age at a more consistent pace. Parrots can live for decades, requiring long-term commitment and specialized care.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of inaccurate age understanding are real:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Owners might provide a 1-year-old dog with puppy food when they should be transitioning to adult food</li>
                            <li>Owners might expect a 10-year-old dog to tolerate the same exercise as a 5-year-old</li>
                            <li>Owners might delay senior health screening because they think their dog is "still young"</li>
                            <li>Owners might be surprised by an elderly dog's behavioral changes if they don't understand what senior dog cognition is like</li>
                            <li>Owners might not recognize pain because they don't understand how aging affects behavior</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Accurate age understanding prevents all of these outcomes and leads to better health, longer quality lifespans, and more compassionate care across the entire pet-owning population.</p>

                        <p>While we provide evidence-based information about pet aging and care, nothing on this website replaces professional veterinary advice.
