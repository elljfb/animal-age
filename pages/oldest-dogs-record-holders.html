                        <p>An Australian Cattle Dog from Queensland, Bluey holds the Guinness World Record for oldest dog ever. Owned by Les Hall, Bluey worked herding cattle and sheep for nearly 20 years before retiring.

                        <h2>What These Records Teach Us</h2>
                        <p><strong>Small Breeds Live Longer:</strong> Nearly all record holders are small breeds (Chihuahua, Jack Russell, Poodle). Small dogs age more slowly, with lower metabolic stress on organs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Active Lifestyle Matters:</strong> Working dogs like Bluey and herding dogs featured prominently. Mental and physical engagement throughout life appears essential.</p>
                        <p><strong>Good Genetics + Good Care:</strong> Most record holders combined favorable breeding with dedicated veterinary attention, quality nutrition, and engaged ownership.</p>
                        <p><strong>Weight Control:</strong> Longevity record holders were generally lean. Obesity dramatically shortens lifespan and accelerates age-related diseases.</p>
                        <p><strong>Veterinary Attention:</strong> Modern record holders benefited from regular check-ups, preventive care, and prompt treatment of health issues.</p>
