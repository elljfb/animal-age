                <p>Retford locals are being encouraged to join in the VE Day commemorations this weekend, as the Nottinghamshire County Show prepares to welcome thousands to a day steeped in history, heritage, and community pride.</p>

                <p>Taking place this Saturday at Newark Showground, the event will feature a spectacular RAF Spitfire flypast, a parade of vintage wartime farm vehicles, and a variety of traditional showground attractions — all paying tribute to the county's enduring agricultural legacy and the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.</p>

                <p>With Retford's own strong agricultural roots and close ties to wartime efforts, the commemorations are expected to resonate deeply with local residents. Organisers say the event isn't just a celebration of the county's farming past, but a recognition of the pivotal role Nottinghamshire – including the farming communities around Retford – played during the Second World War.</p>

                <p>The centrepiece of the day will be a stirring flypast from a Spitfire of the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, set to soar over the showground just after midday. This aerial tribute has become a cherished highlight of the county show, drawing in crowds from across the region, including many from Retford and surrounding villages.</p>

                <p>Now in its 140th year, the Nottinghamshire County Show has long been a fixture in the local calendar. Kicking off from 9am, the event offers a packed programme including motorcycle stunt displays, livestock competitions with some of the region's finest cattle, sheep and pigs, equestrian events, and a bustling food and drink village.</p>

                <p>Families from Retford will also find plenty to enjoy in the Make, Bake and Grow section, and youngsters can cheer on the ever-popular lawnmower racing, organised by the Notts Young Farmers Clubs. There'll also be live music, a farrier competition, community cookery demos, and a zone showcasing the work of local organisations.</p>

                <p>But it's the VE Day parade in the main ring that's likely to tug on the heartstrings. The procession will begin with heavy horses – once the backbone of local farms – before moving on to a nostalgic showcase of wartime agricultural vehicles, including classic tractors and even a Willys Jeep, a former US Army vehicle widely adopted by British farmers after the war.</p>

                <p>Music will come courtesy of the South Notts Hussars Association Band, Mansfield District Corps of Drums, and the Nottingham Boys' Brigade and Girls Association, creating a fitting soundtrack to a deeply reflective segment of the show.</p>

                <p>The parade has been curated by Ben Skipper, a respected military and agricultural historian, who says the display offers a glimpse into how farming in places like Retford transformed during the war years.</p>

                <p>"Before the war, British agriculture — including in areas like Retford — was in decline," he explains. "But wartime necessity led to massive changes. Farmers were encouraged to plough grasslands, grow more staple crops like potatoes and wheat, and make use of imported machinery."</p>

                <p>He also paid tribute to the many hands who kept local farms running: "There were the Land Girls, of course, but also evacuees and conscientious objectors, all working to help feed the nation right here in Nottinghamshire."</p>

                <p>The show is hosted annually by the Newark and Nottinghamshire Agricultural Society (NNAS), a charity committed to celebrating and supporting rural life across the Midlands.</p>

                <p>Show organiser Elizabeth Halsall added: "Marking the 80th anniversary of VE Day is incredibly important, particularly for communities like Retford, where so many served both on the frontline and in the fields. The Spitfire flypast and parade will offer a powerful and poignant moment of reflection."</p>

                <p>Tickets are now on sale and organisers are encouraging families from Retford and across Bassetlaw to attend what promises to be a memorable day out. For more details or to book tickets, visit www.nottinghamshirecountyshow.com.</p>
