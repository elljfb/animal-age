<font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Distinguished by a remarkably
long neck and supported by a tremendously powerful backbone, the
Brachiosaurus is often compared to the giraffe largely due to
its asymmetrical body design: the front legs are longer than the
back, creating a sloping effect that makes the creature look even
bigger than its already gargantuan height. The front feet each
feature a single claw, while the hind feet each have three. While
perhaps intended as defensive measures - as if a healthy Brachiosaurus
needed to worry about predators - the claws have proven to fulfill
the more curious purpose of gathering food, as described below.</font>
</p><p>
<b><font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Environment: </font></b>
<font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Due to its disproportionately
large nostrils, it was originally hoped that the Brachiosaurus would
reside mainly in the lagoon.  Once immersed, however, the
substantially higher water pressure at lower depths made breathing
impossible. After a few tragic experiments, the decision was made
to move the Brachiosaurus to the plains.</font>
</p><p>

<b><font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Feeding: </font></b>
<font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Plant-eater.
While the Brachiosaurus prefers to eat from tree tops, it has
surprised everyone with a method of gathering food unique among
the other dinosaurs. Using its front legs for support, the creature
is able to "harvest" its meals from the grassy plains,
tearing the foliage from the soil with its clawed hind legs. </font>
</p><p>

<b><font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Habits: </font></b>
<font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Solitary
nature. Some concern has been expressed over the creature's decidedly
low libido. Testing continues.</font>
</p><p>
<b><font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">Ops Notes:</font></b>
<font size="2" face="Century Schoolbook">
Aside from the (relatively) active exercise of gathering food,
the Brachiosaurus has proven to be a disappointment in the personality
department. It has proven difficult to maintain a healthy population,
as many of the creatures have been dying suddenly. Cause of death
remains a mystery.</font>
