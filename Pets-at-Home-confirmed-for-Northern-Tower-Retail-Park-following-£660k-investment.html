<p><strong>Retford is set to welcome a new major retailer next week after it was confirmed that Pets at Home will be opening at Northern Tower Retail Park.</strong></p>
<p>The 6,000 sq ft store will open its doors on Friday, 28th November, following a &pound;660,000 investment in the town.</p>
<p>Local pet owners will be able to find everything they need under one roof, with the new Petcare Centre offering nutrition consultations, free weight checks, flea and worming advice, and expert guidance on everyday health care.</p>
<p>The opening has also brought a jobs boost for the area, with the team still recruiting for additional roles.</p>
<p>Reece Fisher, senior store manager at the new Retford branch, said: "We're incredibly excited to open the Petcare Centre right here at Northern Tower Retail Park.</p>
<p>"This isn't just a store; it's a haven for pet lovers and their furry friends. With a range of top-tier services and a shopping experience like no other, we've created a space that truly celebrates the joy of pet ownership."</p>
<p>He added: "We can't wait to welcome customers to explore, connect, and see how we're raising the bar for petcare. Whether you're here for your dog's next adventure, your cat's favourite treat, or expert advice for your small animals, we've got everything you need to keep tails wagging, whiskers twitching and hearts full."</p>
<h2>Opening weekend activities</h2>
<p>The grand opening will take place at 9am on Friday, with a packed weekend of activities planned for visitors.</p>
<p>Five 'Golden Bones' will be hidden inside the store each day from Friday to Sunday, with lucky finders receiving a &pound;50 Pets at Home gift voucher.</p>
<p>Families can also enjoy a free face painter on Saturday and Sunday, along with on-the-spot My Pet Pals workshops for children.</p>
<p>The Retford opening forms part of Pets at Home's ongoing investment in its physical stores and local communities across the country.</p>
