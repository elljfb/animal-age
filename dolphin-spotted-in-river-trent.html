                    <p class="lead">Locals were left stunned after a dolphin was spotted swimming in the River Trent near Retford on Friday, 14th November 2025, amid torrential rain and swelling riverbanks.</p>
                    <p>Eyewitness reports began flooding social media in the late morning as several residents walking along the riverside caught sight of the unusual visitor between 10:30 and 11:00 am. The early sightings were soon confirmed by wildlife photographer Alan Reeves, who managed to capture clear images despite the driving rain.</p>
                    <p>“I didn’t believe it at first,” said Reeves. “You expect to see salmon or the odd otter, but a dolphin here—especially with how wild the weather has been this week—was incredible. It was moving surprisingly fast, apparently following the current upstream.”</p>
                    <p>Experts say the persistent heavy rainfall in the region, which led to unusually high water levels in the Trent, may have helped the marine mammal venture so far inland.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Lorna Cassidy, a marine biologist, commented: “Dolphins occasionally enter UK rivers, but sightings in Nottinghamshire are extremely rare. The high water caused by recent storms might have disoriented the animal or allowed it to pursue fish carried up by the flood.”</p>
                    <p>Wildlife rescue teams are currently monitoring the river in hopes of guiding the dolphin back towards safer, more familiar waters. Authorities have urged residents to admire the animal from a distance and avoid approaching, so as not to cause further stress.</p>
                    <p>This remarkable event has brought excitement and curiosity to the community, with many turning out, umbrellas in hand, in the hope of catching a glimpse of the dolphin during Retford’s very wet November.</p>
