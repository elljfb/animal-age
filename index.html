    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Why Pet-to-Human Age Conversion Matters</h2>
      <p>Understanding your pet's age in human years helps you better care for them at every life stage. Pets age at different rates depending on their species, breed, and size. For example, a 2-year-old dog is not equivalent to a 14-year-old humanâ€”this outdated "1 dog year = 7 human years" rule doesn't account for the rapid aging that occurs in the first few years of a pet's life. By knowing your pet's human age equivalent, you can tailor their diet, exercise, and veterinary care to their specific needs.</p>

    <!-- Methodology Section -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>How We Calculate Pet Ages</h2>
      <p>Our calculator uses scientifically accurate formulas based on species, breed size, and life stage. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dogs:</strong> Small, medium, and large breeds age differently. Small dogs mature faster but age slower after reaching adulthood, while large dogs age more quickly throughout their lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Cats:</strong> Cats age rapidly in their first two years, then more slowly afterward.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Pets:</strong> Each species has unique aging patterns. For example, rabbits age quickly in their first year, while reptiles age very slowly.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Small dogs often live longer than large dogs due to slower metabolic rates and reduced stress on their bodies.</li>
          <li>Cats are considered "senior" at around 11 years old, while large dogs may be seniors by age 6.</li>
          <li>The oldest recorded dog lived to be 29 years old, and the oldest cat reached 38 years!</li>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why do small dogs live longer than large dogs?</h3>
        <p>Small dogs tend to have slower metabolic rates and experience less stress on their joints and organs, contributing to longer lifespans.</p>

        <h3>How do cats age compared to dogs?</h3>
        <p>Cats age rapidly in their first two years, then more slowly. Dogs, especially large breeds, age more quickly throughout their lives.</p>

        <h3>At what age is a pet considered "senior"?</h3>
        <p>It varies by species and breed. Cats are typically seniors at 11+, small dogs at 10+, medium dogs at 8+, and large dogs at 6+.</p>
