                <p>Like many, I've experienced the frustration of waiting weeks for a doctor's appointment, or being told there simply isn't enough space or staff to see everyone who needs help. That's why I was so pleased to hear that Retford is set to benefit from a share of £2.1 million in new government funding for GP practices across Nottinghamshire.</p>

                <p>This funding, which has been allocated to 22 practices in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, is expected to create an extra 200,000 appointments for patients across the county. For us here in Retford, it means real improvements are on the way, with work set to start this year and projects expected to be completed by spring 2026.</p>

                <p>For years, our GPs have done their very best under difficult circumstances, but demand keeps rising and it's not always easy to get the care you need when you need it. The new funding will allow practices to expand their facilities, making it easier for more of us to get seen quickly and comfortably. It's not just about bricks and mortar, either – GP teams now include physiotherapists, pharmacists, social prescribers and mental health practitioners, all working together to support our health and wellbeing. But as Amanda Sullivan, chief executive of NHS Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, said, sometimes the physical space just isn't there to make the most of these brilliant new resources.</p>

                <p>Here in Retford, two of our practices are set to see real changes thanks to this funding. <strong>Kingfisher Family Practice</strong> will be converting office space into clinical rooms, creating an estimated 7,500 extra appointments every year at a cost of £130,000. <strong>Crown House Surgery</strong> will be transforming part of its waiting room into a new base for the Care Navigator team, which should mean around 2,000 more appointments annually at a cost of £170,000. Altogether, that's nearly 10,000 extra chances for local people to get the help they need, right here in our town.</p>

                <p>It's heartening to know that every single bid submitted by GPs in Nottinghamshire was successful, and that work will soon be underway. I know many of us have felt the strain on our local NHS, but this investment is a real boost for Retford and a sign that our voices are being heard.</p>

                <p>Let's hope this is just the start of more good news for Retford's NHS services. If you have thoughts or experiences to share about our local GPs, I'd love to hear them in the comments below.</p>
