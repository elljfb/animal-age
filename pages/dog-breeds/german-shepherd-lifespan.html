                        <p>German Shepherds are large, intelligent working dogs known for their loyalty, athleticism, and versatility. Whether as family companions, service dogs, or working partners, German Shepherds form deep bonds with their owners and live active lives. Understanding their lifespan and aging patterns is essential for providing appropriate care.</p>
                        <p>German Shepherds typically live 9-13 years, with an average around 11 years. As a large breed, they age somewhat faster than small dogs but can live well into their senior years with excellent care and health management.</p>

                        <h2>German Shepherd Average Lifespan</h2>
                        <p>German Shepherds have a lifespan of 9-13 years, making them slightly shorter-lived than small breeds due to their larger body size. Large dogs experience accelerated aging due to faster cellular aging and higher metabolic demands on their bodies.</p>
                        <p>Using our size-adjusted aging formula, a German Shepherd's human-equivalent age progression looks like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1-year-old:</strong> ~29 human years (already physically mature)</li>
                            <li><strong>3-year-old:</strong> ~41 human years (prime working age)</li>
                            <li><strong>6-year-old:</strong> ~52 human years (peak adulthood)</li>
                            <li><strong>9-year-old:</strong> ~62 human years (senior)</li>
                            <li><strong>11-year-old:</strong> ~68 human years (geriatric)</li>

                        <h2>Breed-Specific Health Issues Affecting Lifespan</h2>
                        <p><strong>Hip and Elbow Dysplasia:</strong> One of the most common issues in German Shepherds. Poor joint development causes arthritis and pain, especially in senior years. Responsible breeders screen using OFA scores.</p>
                        <p><strong>Degenerative Myelopathy (DM):</strong> A progressive spinal cord disease that causes hind limb weakness and paralysis. Genetic testing can identify carriers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI):</strong> Reduces ability to digest food. Manageable with enzyme supplements but requires lifetime management.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat):</strong> Life-threatening emergency where stomach fills with gas and twists. Deep-chested large breeds like German Shepherds are at higher risk. Symptoms require immediate veterinary attention.</p>
                        <p><strong>Megaesophagus:</strong> Enlarged esophagus affecting swallowing and digestion.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="featured-section">
                        <h2>German Shepherd Senior Care</h2>
                        <p><strong>Hip Support:</strong> As German Shepherds age, hip dysplasia becomes painful. Joint supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin), maintaining ideal weight, and low-impact exercise like swimming help manage pain.</p>
                        <p><strong>Spinal Awareness:</strong> Watch for signs of degenerative myelopathy: hind limb weakness, difficulty rising, or loss of coordination. Early detection helps manage progression.</p>
                        <p><strong>Emergency Preparedness:</strong> Know bloat symptoms (restlessness, unproductive vomiting, distended abdomen) and have emergency veterinary care available. Bloat is a surgical emergency.</p>
                        <p><strong>Regular Screening:</strong> Twice-yearly veterinary visits in senior years. Include bloodwork, urinalysis, and physical exams to catch problems early.</p>
