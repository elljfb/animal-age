                        <p>French Bulldogs are small, muscular dogs with distinctive bat-like ears and charming personalities. As one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States, many owners wonder about their lifespan and what to expect as their Frenchie ages.</p>
                        <p>French Bulldogs typically live 10-14 years, with some individuals living into their mid-to-late teens with excellent care. Their small size is advantageous for longevity—smaller dog breeds generally live longer than large breeds. However, French Bulldogs have specific health considerations due to their brachycephalic (flat-faced) structure that can affect lifespan and quality of life.</p>

                        <h2>French Bulldog Average Lifespan</h2>
                        <p>French Bulldogs have an average lifespan of 10-14 years, with many living to 12-13 years. This is longer than larger breeds like Golden Retrievers (10-12 years) due to their smaller body size and slower aging rate.</p>
                        <p>Using our size-adjusted logarithmic formula for small dogs, a French Bulldog ages like this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1-year-old:</strong> ~30 human years</li>
                            <li><strong>3-year-old:</strong> ~42 human years</li>
                            <li><strong>7-year-old:</strong> ~56 human years</li>
                            <li><strong>10-year-old:</strong> ~66 human years</li>
                            <li><strong>12-year-old:</strong> ~72 human years</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Breed-Specific Health Issues Affecting Lifespan</h2>
                        <p><strong>Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome:</strong> The flat face that makes French Bulldogs adorable can create breathing difficulties. Narrowed airways, elongated soft palate, and stenotic nares (narrow nostrils) make breathing labored, especially in heat or during exercise. This condition can reduce lifespan and quality of life.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hip Dysplasia:</strong> Common in French Bulldogs, this joint condition causes pain and mobility issues in senior years.</p>
                        <p><strong>Spinal Issues:</strong> Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is common in the breed due to their elongated spine relative to body size. Serious cases can cause paralysis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eye Problems:</strong> Cherry eye, cataracts, and other eye conditions are breed-prone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Skin Allergies:</strong> French Bulldogs are prone to allergies and skin infections, particularly in facial folds.</p>

                        <h2>Supporting Your French Bulldog's Health</h2>
                        <p><strong>Climate Control:</strong> Keep Frenchies cool—they overheat easily due to breathing limitations. Air conditioning is essential in hot climates.</p>
                        <p><strong>Exercise Moderation:</strong> Avoid strenuous exercise and excessive heat exposure. Short, gentle walks are ideal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dental Care:</strong> French Bulldogs are prone to dental disease. Regular brushing and professional cleanings extend both lifespan and health.</p>
                        <p><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Obesity exacerbates breathing problems and joint stress. Maintain ideal weight throughout life.</p>
                        <p><strong>Skin Fold Hygiene:</strong> Clean facial folds regularly to prevent yeast and bacterial infections.</p>
