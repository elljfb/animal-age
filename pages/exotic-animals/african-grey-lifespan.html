                        <p>African Grey Parrots (Congo and Timneh subspecies) are among the most intelligent birds, native to the rainforests of West and Central Africa. Known for exceptional cognitive abilities (intelligence comparable to a 4-6 year-old child), remarkable talking ability, and complex personalities, African Greys form deep bonds with their owners. However, they're not casual pets—they demand decades of commitment, specialized care, and emotional engagement.</p>
                        <p>African Greys typically live 40-60 years in captivity, with some reaching 80+ years. Congo African Greys average slightly longer (45-65 years) than Timneh subspecies (35-50 years). This is a lifetime commitment potentially outlasting their owners.</p>

                        <h2>African Grey Average Lifespan</h2>
                        <p><strong>Congo African Grey:</strong> 40-65 years, larger subspecies (14-15 inches), larger tail</p>
                        <p><strong>Timneh African Grey:</strong> 35-50 years, smaller subspecies (10-13 inches), maroon tail feathers</p>

                            <li><strong>Hatchling (0-1 year):</strong> Requires intensive hand-feeding, socialization</li>
                            <li><strong>Juvenile (1-4 years):</strong> Continued socialization, learning, development</li>
                            <li><strong>Adolescent (4-10 years):</strong> Sexual maturity, behavioral changes, hormonal fluctuations</li>

                        <h2>Determining African Grey Age</h2>
                        <p><strong>Eye Ring Maturation:</strong> Young African Greys (under 6 months) have dark eyes. The distinctive white eye ring (bare skin patch) develops over first year and becomes more prominent with age.</p>
                        <p><strong>Plumage Condition:</strong> Juveniles have dull feathers and may show incomplete coloring. Adults have vibrant red tail feathers (Congo) or maroon (Timneh), glossy black plumage, and pristine condition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Behavioral Markers:</strong> Young birds are constantly moving and exploring. Sexual maturity (around 4-6 years) brings behavioral changes. Senior birds show reduced activity, increased vocalization of contact calls.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wing Feather Condition:</strong> Young birds have pointed primary wing feathers. With age and molting, feather edges become rounded.</p>

                    <section class="featured-section">
                        <h2>Senior African Grey Care</h2>
                        <p><strong>Cognitive Engagement:</strong> Mental stimulation remains critical throughout life. Puzzle toys, training, and social interaction keep senior birds mentally sharp. Boredom leads to behavioral problems (feather plucking, aggression).</p>
                        <p><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Senior African Greys are prone to fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis), diabetes, arthritis, and kidney disease. Maintain lean weight through appropriate diet (pellets, vegetables, limited nuts).</p>
                        <p><strong>Veterinary Care:</strong> Annual avian veterinary exams become critical. Blood work screening (every 2-3 years) helps catch diseases early. Avian veterinarians are specialized and must have avian experience.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sleep and Rest:</strong> Senior birds may need more sleep (10-12 hours nightly) to maintain health. Provide quiet roosting areas away from household activity.</p>

                        <p>African Greys are unique among pets in that they often outlive their owners. They form monogamous pair bonds with humans and may suffer severe behavioral and psychological problems if their bonded person dies without proper transition planning. Responsible ownership includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designating a caretaker in your will</li>
                            <li>Creating detailed care instructions</li>
                            <li>Setting aside financial resources for lifetime care</li>
                            <li>Ensuring designated caretaker actually wants the responsibility</li>
                            <li>Socializing bird to multiple family members to reduce dependency</li>
                        </ul>
