                <div class="article-content">
                    <p class="lead">Bassetlaw District Council has unveiled ambitious plans to breathe new life into Retford's historic town centre, with a comprehensive redevelopment scheme focused on the iconic Market Square and surrounding areas.</p>

                    <p>The £4.5 million project, which has been in development for over 18 months, aims to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment while preserving the Georgian character that makes Retford's town centre unique. The plans were revealed at a public consultation event held at the Town Hall on Tuesday evening, attended by over 200 local residents and business owners.</p>

                    <h2>Key Features of the Development</h2>

                    <p>The proposals include expanding pedestrianized zones around Market Square, creating wider pavements on Carolgate and improving access for cyclists and wheelchair users. New seating areas and green spaces will be integrated throughout the town centre, with particular attention paid to creating family-friendly areas.</p>

                    <p>"This is about creating a town centre that works for everyone," said Councillor David Pressley, Cabinet Member for Regeneration. "We want to honour Retford's rich history while ensuring it remains a vibrant, thriving place for future generations."</p>

                    <p>The development will also see improvements to market facilities, with upgraded stalls and enhanced infrastructure for traders. The historic Retford Market, which has been operating since medieval times, will continue to run throughout the construction period, though some temporary relocations may be necessary.</p>

                    <h2>Support for Local Businesses</h2>

                    <p>A significant component of the plan focuses on supporting independent retailers and encouraging new businesses to open in the town centre. This includes a grant scheme of up to £10,000 for shop front improvements and a reduction in business rates for qualifying new ventures during their first year of operation.</p>

                    <p>Local business owner Margaret Foster, who has run a gift shop on Grove Street for 23 years, expressed cautious optimism: "Any improvement to foot traffic and the general appearance of the town centre can only be good for business. I just hope they can minimize disruption during the work."</p>

                    <h2>Timeline and Public Consultation</h2>

                    <p>The public consultation period will run until 3rd December 2025, with residents encouraged to submit feedback via the council's website or at drop-in sessions scheduled throughout November. Subject to approval and final planning permissions, construction work is expected to begin in spring 2026, with completion targeted for late 2027.</p>

                    <p>The project will be funded through a combination of council reserves, a successful Towns Fund bid, and contributions from Nottinghamshire County Council. No increase in council tax is expected as a result of the development.</p>

                    <p>Detailed plans and supporting documents are available to view at the Retford Library and on the Bassetlaw District Council website. The next public consultation event is scheduled for 20th November at King Edward VI Grammar School, 6:30-8:30 PM.</p>
