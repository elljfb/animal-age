                <p>Retford is set to welcome a new addition to its charitable retail sector, as The Donkey Charity announces plans to open its first shop in the town centre in late 2025.</p>

                <p>The charity, which provides care and protection for donkeys across Africa and the Middle East, aims to establish a significant presence in North Nottinghamshire through this new venture. CEO Paul Williamson described the expansion as "a natural step" in the organisation's growth.</p>

                <p>"Retford's strong community spirit and dedication to charitable causes makes it the perfect location for our newest shop," said Williamson. "We've been overwhelmed by the positive response from local residents during our planning phase."</p>

                <p>The shop, which will occupy a prime position in the town centre, will offer a carefully curated selection of second-hand items, alongside the charity's branded merchandise. All proceeds will directly support the sanctuary's work in donkey welfare and rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>Local business owner Sharon Godson welcomed the announcement: "It's wonderful to see another charity choosing Retford for their expansion. The shop will certainly bring more footfall to the town centre, and it's for such a worthy cause."</p>

                <p>The Donkey Charity plans to staff the shop primarily with local volunteers, creating new opportunities for community involvement. "We're already receiving enquiries from potential volunteers," explained Williamson. "The enthusiasm we've encountered in Retford has been truly heartening."</p>

                <p>The charity estimates that the shop could raise up to Â£5,000 annually for their cause, funds that will contribute to their ongoing work in donkey welfare and public education programmes.</p>

                <p>The exact opening date will be announced in the coming months as negotiations with a retail space are ongoing, with the charity planning a grand opening celebration featuring some of their sanctuary residents as special guests on Zoom calls from Africa and the Middle East.</p>

                <p>Those interested in volunteering opportunities are encouraged to register their interest through The Donkey Charity's website.</p>
